# Future Roadmap: Biological Data Adaptation

This roadmap outlines the strategic pathway for adapting the CNN-LSTM voltage forecasting system from simulated Brunel networks to real biological neural data, including organoids, MEA recordings, and calcium imaging datasets.

## Phase 6: Real Data Integration (Next 3-6 months)

### 6.1 Multi-Electrode Array (MEA) Integration

**Objective**: Adapt CNN-LSTM architecture for high-density MEA recordings from neural cultures and organoids.

**Technical Adaptations**:
```python
# MEA-specific modifications
ModelConfig:
    input_size: 64-256        # MEA electrode count
    sampling_rate: 20_000     # 20kHz typical MEA sampling
    sequence_length: 1000     # 50ms windows at high resolution
    spatial_layout: True      # Preserve electrode geometry
```

**Key Challenges**:
- **Noise Handling**: Real MEA data has 10-100x more noise than simulations
- **Artifacts**: Movement artifacts, electrode impedance changes, stimulation artifacts
- **Spatial Geometry**: Incorporate actual electrode positions for spatial convolutions
- **Variable Sampling**: Different MEA systems use 10-40 kHz sampling rates

**Proposed Solutions**:
1. **Adaptive Preprocessing**: Robust artifact detection and removal pipeline
2. **Spatial-Aware CNN**: Convolutions respecting electrode geometry
3. **Multi-Resolution**: Different temporal scales for spikes vs. LFPs
4. **Transfer Learning**: Fine-tune on MEA data starting from Brunel-trained weights

### 6.2 Calcium Imaging Integration

- **Spatial Resolution**: 1000+ neurons vs. 64-256 electrodes
- **Noise Characteristics**: Photon noise, motion artifacts, bleaching

**Architecture Modifications**:
```python
# Calcium-specific CNN-LSTM
ModelConfig:

    temporal_kernel: 5        # Broader temporal filters
    calcium_dynamics: True    # Calcium kinetics modeling
    baseline_correction: True # Handle fluorescence drift
```
